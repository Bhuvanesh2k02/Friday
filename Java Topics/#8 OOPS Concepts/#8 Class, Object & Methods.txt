OOPS Concepts:
Class
Object
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Data Abstraction

Class:
1) Class is a collection of attributes and behavior. ex. Animal (Class)-->Dog, Elephant, Horse, etc.
2) Class is collection of Variables and methods.
3) Class is Logical entity/blue print.
4) Will not occupied any space in the memory.
Syntax:
Class Employee {
Variables
Methods
}

Object:
1) Object is an instance of a class/object will be created by using class.
2) Object is physical entity.
3) Occupy space in memory.
4) We can create multiple objects for single class.
Syntax:
Employee emp=new Employee();
"Employee" is a variable type.
"emp" is a variable name.
"new Employee()" is hold the objects of the employee class.
"Employee()" is basically called as Constructor.

Methods:
public static void main(String[] args){
}
1) This method is special type of the method.
2) We should not compare to normal method because if you create an main method then only we execute the class.
3) if you do not have an main method you can not execute the class.
4) execution is always starts from the main method.
5) Java is always look for the main the method in class before execution.
6) That is the reason you have to create the main method in the class.
extra point:7) We can create many classes in our project but all the classes we will control or we will organize from one main class and which should contains a main method.
