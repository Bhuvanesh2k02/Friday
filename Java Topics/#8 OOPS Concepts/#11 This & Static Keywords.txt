Types of Variable:
1. Class variable or instance variable.
2. Local variable.
3. Global variable.-> we should not use this type of variable in java.

class variable - it is used in class but outside of the methods.
local variable - it is used in methods.
global variable - it is used in outside of the class.

"this" Keyword:
 Whenever we are using class variable name and local variable name are same, then we have to differentiate them by using "this" keyword weather it is in method or constructor.
example:
Constructor:
method1(int a, int b)
{
this.a=a;
this.b=b;
}
Method:
void method1(int a, int b)
{
this.a=a;
this.b=b;
}

Static keyword:
Static keyword can be applied for variables and methods.

when we have to use static keyword?
Why we have to use static keyword?
What is the Benefit of static keyword?

1.Static method can access static stuff directly without creating object.
2.Static method can access non-static stuff through object.
3.non-static method can access everything directly.

example:
class System
{
static PrintStream Out;
}

invoking class: System.Out.Println();
System - it is a predefind class in java.
Out - it is a Printstream of variable of static type.
Println or print- the method which is belongs to printstream class.
